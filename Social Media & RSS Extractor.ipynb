Here is a note that I am sharing with the GE team about actions we are taking on what will be a long and much-needed journey toward sustainable change with real impact. I invite your thoughts and deeply appreciate your support.After 40 years of service, David Joyce, vice chair of GE and president and CEO of GE Aviation, will retire from the company.

After a first-hand experience with COVID-19, the pair were inspired to create new ways to support and empower women through the Brem Foundation during the pandemic.Don’t be fooled by the beautiful fall foliage—this 7,000 acre test operation facility in Peebles, OH is actually the location for a grueling jet engine bootcamp. As part of our certification testing, we push our jet engines to their absolute limits to make sure they not only meet our design expectations, but can handle the most extreme conditions. To do this for the GE9X, we actually had to upgrade our facility to accommodate such a large engine! https://invent.ge/35yAGXZAt GE, we deal with big numbers every day.

Mainly, the lack of coach! Those big computer-looking things are data consoles, which our engineers use to test our GE9X engine. They collect massive amounts of data, which is then used to analyze and make improvements to our jet engines. https://invent.ge/2DlXD4BWhen people ask me what got me started in aviation, I always say it started with my dad. He passed his love for aviation on to me. And it was that passion that led to my military service as a Marine, and eventually, a rewarding career here at GE. https://invent.ge/34obKlLHere Mikey Kay visits the plant where GE Healthcare is ramping up production of what Brian McEathron refers to as a ”super power” in the hands of clinicians. #COVID19 #GEfortheFrontlinesBuilding the GE9X is definitely a global effort.

We have shared words of support for our friends, colleagues and communities. We need to take action as well. At Facebook, we’re focused on building powerful tools and resources. We’re taking steps to improve our products, programs and policies. We pooled ideas from diverse groups of our employees across different teams on how we can better fight against racial injustice. Today we are sharing that we’re already putting some of these to work. Building on earlier investments, we’re committing an additional $200 million to support Black-owned businesses and organizations. This commitment is part of a broader $1.1 billion investment in Black and diverse suppliers and communities in the US. We’re also creating a new space in the Facebook app called Lift Black Voices and we’re building a more diverse and inclusive workforce so we can better support communities around the world. Investing in the Black Community From the early days of the pandemic, we have been listening to small businesses and trying to do what we can to help them weather the storm – including direct financial help through our $40 million US grant program. Since we opened applications for the program, we have seen a huge amount of interest from Black-owned businesses – so we know they are facing enormous challenges. When we asked for ideas from employees, many suggested that there was much more we could do to support them. Elevating Black Voices and Stories We’re creating a new space in the Facebook app called Lift Black Voices to highlight stories from Black people, share educational resources, and inspire people to take action through fundraising for racial justice causes. We asked employees to share ideas for new products and features to help fight racial injustice, and this was one of the more than 700 ideas submitted so far.  In Instagram search, we’ll surface accounts to help people take action for racial justice. We’re also continuing our #ShareBlackStories editorial series on @instagram, @instagramforbusiness, @creators, @shop and @design to amplify the voices of Black creators, artists, activists and businesses. We’ll continue to build on these over time. A More Diverse and Inclusive Workforce We know that more diverse teams will make better decisions and build better products. We’re invested in increasing diversity and inclusion because we care about doing better at serving diverse communities all around the world. Achieving racial justice and equity is a goal all of us share – and a goal that will take real work to achieve. This is just the start of how we plan to help in this fight. We’ll continue to listen and take action to support the long-term success of the Black community.

As I explained in the introduction to our Privacy Matters page, our privacy work is never finished, and we’re committed to communicating transparently about the steps we’re taking to make our systems better and more protective of people’s privacy. Below are several examples of our recent efforts. Taking Action Against Platform Abuse In addition to the proactive technical work we do to protect people’s privacy and prevent data misuse, we take legal action when needed to hold people accountable for abusing our platform. Today we filed lawsuits in Spain and the US to enforce our Terms against using automated means to abuse our services. The defendants in Spain used automation software designed to evade Instagram’s restrictions against fake engagement, and the defendant in the US asked people to provide their Facebook login credentials and then used these credentials to scrape people’s data from Facebook. In both cases, we sent Cease and Desist letters and disabled accounts prior to filing lawsuits. We ultimately took legal action to hold these defendants accountable for violating our policies and trying to undermine the integrity of our services. We also recently reached a settlement in our case against Rankwave, a South Korean data analytics company that ran apps on the Facebook platform, and failed to verify their compliance with our policies. Rankwave agreed to an audit and a permanent injunction banning them from using Facebook in the future. This legal action was one of the first of its kind and demonstrates our commitment to enforcing our policies to better protect people. More Consistency for Private Groups When people are part of a group on Facebook, it’s important they know who can see their information and the content they share. Last year, we simplified the privacy settings for Groups, and based on feedback we’ve received, we recently started notifying people that we are removing the option for groups to change their privacy setting from Private to Public. This limitation already exists for groups with more than 5,000 members, and now we’ve expanded it to all private groups so our settings are clearer and more consistent. Protecting Privacy in Our Data for Good Program The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted how data can help inform response efforts for major crises. In that vein, our Data for Good program aims to help researchers, nonprofits and other groups address these issues, but it’s critical that we protect people’s privacy while sharing data. That’s why we put mechanisms in place to protect your information when we share it and give you control over your data. We recently highlighted how we make privacy central to this work. For example, partners enrolled in the Data for Good program only have access to aggregate information from Facebook – we don’t share any individual information. Some datasets are shared publicly, but these are formatted to help prevent re-identification, while preserving insights that are useful in responding to crises. We also use a differential privacy framework that further protects the privacy of individuals in aggregated datasets by ensuring no specific person can be re-identified. This allows us to make these datasets available publicly to help inform the public sector response to humanitarian crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, while protecting people’s privacy.

This is one of the first times a social media company is using coordinated, multi-jurisdictional litigation to enforce its Terms and protect its users. The defendants in the European lawsuit operated a Spain-based fake engagement service, and the defendant in the US lawsuit operated a data scraping service with ties to California. These lawsuits also allege the defendants violated the laws of Spain and the US, including Spain’s protections for databases and online platforms and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in the US. We are seeking injunctions to reinforce our permanent ban against their use of our platform. Facebook Inc. and Facebook Ireland sued MGP25 Cyberint Services and its founder in the commercial court of Madrid for providing automation software to distribute fake likes and comments on Instagram. The defendant’s service was designed to evade Instagram’s restrictions against fake engagement by mimicking the official Instagram app in the way that it connected to our systems. The defendants did this for profit, and continued to do so even after we sent a Cease and Desist letter and disabled their accounts. Facebook Inc. also sued Mohammad Zaghar in federal court in San Francisco for operating a data scraping service called Massroot8. This service asked people to provide their Facebook login credentials on the Massroot8 website. The credentials were then used by Zaghar’s service to scrape user data from Facebook. Zaghar collected the data by using a computer program to control a network of bots, which pretended to be an Android device connected to the official Facebook mobile app. The defendant engaged in this abuse even after Facebook sent a Cease and Desist letter and disabled his accounts. Today’s legal actions demonstrate our commitment to enforcing our policies and holding people accountable for abusing our services.

An important part of the changes we’re making to our privacy approach is communicating more transparently about our work. Over the past year we’ve written about how we build privacy into our products and how we use data. Now we’re expanding on this and creating a page where we’ll share regular updates about our privacy work, from in-depth posts on some of the hard technical questions we encounter, to actions we’re taking against those who try to undermine privacy on our platform. In these posts we’ll explain improvements we make to further protect people’s privacy, continue to share how we design privacy into our products, highlight advances we make to the technology that keeps people’s information safe, and provide more transparency into things we find and fix. We’ve also placed more emphasis on privacy as a company. For example, we improved our onboarding process for new employees to ensure everyone understands our focus on privacy from day one, and we require all employees to complete an annual privacy training course that reinforces our obligations to protect privacy and treat data responsibly. As part of our Privacy Review process for new products or updates, we look closely at how we use data, assess risks, and put safeguards in place to address them. We will also report on our privacy practices to the newly formed Privacy Committee on our Board of Directors. And an independent, third-party assessor will review our practices and report on them to the Privacy Committee and the FTC. Our work on privacy is never finished. We’re focused on this every day, and we’ll share updates about both our successes and the lessons we’ve learned in improving our products and practices.

With the US elections less than five months away, today Facebook is launching the largest voting information campaign in American history. We’re building a new Voting Information Center that will give millions of people accurate information about voting, while also giving them the tools they need to register and make their voices heard at the ballot box. Our goal is to help register 4 million voters this year using Facebook, Instagram and Messenger, and help them get to the polls so they can hold our leaders accountable. This goal is double the estimated 2 million people we helped register in both 2018 and 2016. COVID-19 has forced many states to make changes to voting, creating uncertainty in the minds of some voters and opportunities for election interference. We surveyed potential voters and 62% said they believe people will need more information on how to vote this year than they needed in previous elections. We’ve built some of the most advanced systems in the world to combat election interference. The Voting Information Center will be another line of defense. By getting clear, accurate and authoritative information to people, we reduce the effectiveness of malicious networks that might try to take advantage of uncertainty and interfere with the election. The Voting Information Center will also be a place where people can get information about registering to vote, or requesting an absentee or mail-in ballot, depending on the rules in their state. People will also be able to see local election alerts from their officials about changes to the voting process. Our intention is simple but ambitious: to help every eligible voter in the US who uses our platform vote this year. In March, we created our COVID-19 Information Center, which has been providing trusted information from health authorities about the pandemic. Now we’re using the same approach to help people vote this year. We are also working with state election officials and other experts to ensure the Voting Information Center accurately reflects the latest information in each state. The information we highlight will change to meet the needs of voters as we move into different phases of the election like registration periods, deadlines to request a vote-by-mail ballot, the start of early voting, and Election Day.   The Voting Information Center will include: Starting this summer, we will put the Voting Information Center at the top of people’s Facebook and Instagram feeds. We expect more than 160 million people in the US will see this authoritative information about how to vote in the general election from July through November. We’re also working on updates to the registration reminders, vote-by-mail information, and election day reminders that we’ve run throughout the primaries. These updates will make it even easier for people to find reliable information about participating in the election and share it with their friends across Facebook, Instagram and Messenger. We’ll have more to share here soon. More Control and Transparency for Political Ads Political ads play an important role in every election – and this year will be no exception. People have told us they want the option to see fewer political ads on Facebook and Instagram. After announcing this feature earlier this year we are now making it available as part of our preparations for the 2020 US elections. Starting today for some people and rolling out to everyone in the US over the next few weeks, people will be able to turn off all social issue, electoral or political ads from candidates, Super PACs or other organizations that have the “Paid for by” political disclaimer on them. You can do this on Facebook or Instagram directly from any political or social issue ad or through each platform’s ad settings. However, we know our system isn’t perfect. So if you’ve selected this preference and still see an ad that you think is political, please click the upper right corner of the ad and report it to us. We’re rolling out this option in the US to start, and we’ll aim to make it available in countries where we have enforcement on ads about social issues, elections and politics later this fall. We’re also taking two additional steps to make political advertising more transparent. Previously, when someone shared a political or issue ad to their profile or posted it on a Page, the “Paid for by” political disclaimer did not appear on shares, creating confusion about whether the share was an ad or not. Starting today, disclaimers will stay on any political or issue ad that is shared so people can see who is behind it and who paid for it. Lastly, we’re adding a new feature to the Ad Library, allowing you to track ad spending for US House and Senate races, in addition to spending for the candidates in the Presidential race. We’ll also offer a custom tracker to compare the spending of advertisers running political or issue ads. This will help you understand how much advertisers and candidates are spending to reach voters.

Today, we’re sharing new features that make Portal more useful and fun.* Messenger Rooms on Portal Starting today, you can easily hang out with friends and family on group video calls with Messenger Rooms on Portal. Host celebrations with up to 50 people, gather a book club, or just hang out on the couch with friends. You can also entertain the crowd with AR effects and Story Time. And you don’t need to make a call and hope it’s a good time — anyone invited to a call can drop by at their convenience, even if they don’t have a Facebook account.  New Backgrounds on Calls Distractions in the background? No problem. Blur your background or replace your background with a pre-selected image using Portal Spaces while on a Messenger or Messenger Rooms call on Portal. Portal Spaces immerse you in dynamic backdrops that change over time – travel inside a private jet as clouds pass the windows, kick back in a field of flowers that turns luminescent depending on the time of day, or hang out on a tropical island as birds fly by.  Go Live From Portal to Facebook Pages and Groups You can also go Live from Portal to Facebook Pages and Groups using your Portal Mini, Portal, or Portal+. Previously, the Facebook Live app on Portal let you broadcast to your personal profile, and now you can also go Live on your Facebook Pages and Groups.  Photo Ops, AR Effects and New Story Time Stories Share photos from your phone using the Portal mobile app with friends and family while on a Messenger call. We’re also introducing new AR effects to keep you entertained while you’re on a call, including AR Virtual Cards, which allow you to send immersive cards to celebrate special occasions. Later this month, we’ll bring two new stories to Story Time on Portal including The Okay Book by Todd Parr and How To Eat Pizza by Jon Burgerman with more titles coming this summer.  Additional “Hey Portal” Functionality “Hey Portal” already lets you start a hands-free video call or get a morning briefing. And in the coming weeks, we’ll add new “Hey Portal” functionality, including “Hey Portal” commands in British English and the ability to start WhatsApp calls.** More to Come These are just the latest updates to Portal, and there’s more on the way. Visit portal.facebook.com for additional details about these features and more. To stay up to date, follow Portal on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.  *Product availability varies.

People will be able to send money securely or make a purchase from a local business without leaving their chat. The over 10 million small and micro businesses are the heartbeat of Brazil’s communities. It’s become second nature to send a\\xa0zap to a business to get questions answered. Now, in addition to viewing a store’s\\xa0catalog, customers will be able to send payments for products as well. Making payments simple can help bring more businesses into the digital economy, opening up new opportunities for growth. In addition, we’re making sending money to loved ones as easy as sending a message, which could not be more important as people are physically distant from one another. Because payments on WhatsApp are enabled by\\xa0Facebook Pay, in the future, we want to make it possible for people and businesses to use the same card information across Facebook’s family of apps. We have built payments with security in mind and a special six digit PIN or fingerprint will be required to prevent unauthorized transactions. To start, we will support debit or credit cards from Banco do Brasil, Nubank, and Sicredi on the Visa and Mastercard networks – and we are working with Cielo, the leading payments processor in Brazil. We have built an open model to welcome more partners in the future. Sending money or making a purchase on WhatsApp is free for people. Businesses will pay a processing fee to receive customer payments, similar to what they may already pay when accepting a credit card transaction. Payments on WhatsApp are beginning to roll out to people across Brazil today and we look forward to bringing it to everyone as we go forward.

Our response can be found below. We live in a democracy, where the elected officials decide the rules around campaigns. Two weeks ago the President of the United States issued an executive order directing Federal agencies to prevent social media sites from engaging in activities like fact-checking political statements. This week, the Democratic candidate for President started a petition calling on us to do the exact opposite. Just as they have done with broadcast networks — where the US government prohibits rejecting politicians’ campaign ads — the people’s elected representatives should set the rules, and we will follow them. There is an election coming in November and we will protect political speech, even when we strongly disagree with it.

At Facebook, we use sophisticated technology and behavioral signals not only to prevent, detect and remove images and videos that exploit children, but also to detect and prevent grooming, or potentially inappropriate interactions between a minor and an adult. And we use this technology across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. But any industry-wide problem requires solutions broader than just one company – we need a robust international effort to combat this problem. That’s why today, Facebook joined Google, Microsoft and 15 other tech companies to announce the formation of Project Protect: A plan to combat online child sexual abuse – a renewed commitment and\\xa0 investment from the Technology Coalition expanding its scope and impact to protect kids online and guide its work for the next 15 years. Project Protect will focus on five key areas: “Project Protect brings together the brightest minds from across the tech industry to tackle a grave issue that no one company can solve on its own – child exploitation and abuse. Facebook is proud to help lead this initiative that we hope will lead to real changes that keep children safe.” – Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook COO Our cross-industry work to protect kids online extends beyond today’s announcement. For example, we made our photo and video-matching technologies open source, which allows industry partners, developers and non-profits to more easily identify abusive content, share hashes — or digital fingerprints — of different types of harmful content and allow hash-sharing systems to communicate with each other, making the systems that much more powerful. We also recently hosted our fifth child safety hackathon, where we brought together engineers, data scientists and designers from across the industry as well as non-profit partners NCMEC, Thorn, SaferNet Brazil, INHOPE, Cybertip.ca, and IWF, to code and prototype more than a dozen projects focused on making the internet a safer place for children. Following the event, we committed to help fund the Internet Watch Foundation’s initiative for young people to confidentially report self-generated sexual images of minors. And we recently committed to help fund a project led by Tech Matters that will develop new technology to support child helplines and make them more accessible to children in crisis. We have also taken steps across our apps to make the broader internet safer for children. This includes running PhotoDNA on links shared on all our apps from other internet sites and their associated content to detect known child exploitation housed elsewhere on the internet. Not only does this help keep our platforms safer, but it also helps keep the broader internet safer as all violating content is shared with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) who work with local law enforcement around the world. Lastly, we continue to innovate and use best-in-class technology to prevent abuse as we expand the privacy and security of our messaging services. For example, last month we announced a new safety feature in Messenger that provides tips for spotting suspicious activity, encourages people under the age of 18 to be cautious when interacting with an adult they may not know, and empowers them to block or ignore someone when something doesn’t seem right.

We’re also working to address the long-term impacts by supporting industries in need and making it easier for people to find and offer help in their communities. Here’s an overview of how we’re providing access to accurate information, supporting relief efforts and keeping people connected. We’ll continue to add to this post as we announce updates. 1. Ensuring everyone has access to accurate information and removing harmful content 2. Supporting health and economic relief efforts 3. Keeping people connected Expanding Our Blood Donations Feature COVID-19 has led to blood shortages around the world due to shelter in place orders limiting the ability for people to donate. To help, we’re expanding our Facebook Blood Donations feature to connect more people to their local blood banks, so they know when there is a shortage and where it is safe to donate. The Blood Donations feature is now available in South Africa, Senegal, Kenya, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire and Egypt as well as the US, India, Brazil, Pakistan and Bangladesh. We’re also working with partners in India and Brazil to connect people with more local blood banks and hospitals through the Blood Donations feature. And in the US, we’re excited to announce a new partnership with AABB to connect people to hospital blood banks.  Allowing the Promotion of Non-Medical Masks on Facebook and Instagram Since the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, governments and authorities around the world have evolved their guidance on the need to wear masks. In March, we temporarily banned ads and commerce listings for masks on our apps to help protect against scams, misleading medical claims, medical supply shortages, inflated prices and hoarding. Since then, we’ve continued to monitor trends and activity around COVID-19 to better understand how people are using our platform and advertising tools during the pandemic. Many health authorities now advise wearing non-medical masks – and in some places masks are required for activities like taking public transportation or visiting a store – and we’ve seen people and businesses of all sizes working to fill this need. So we’re scaling back this temporary ban to allow people to promote and trade non-medical masks, including those that are homemade or handmade, in organic posts, ads and commerce listings on Facebook and Instagram. We will still maintain a temporary ban on selling medical masks, such as surgical or N95 masks, to prevent people from exploiting the pandemic for financial gain. You can learn more about how we define non-medical masks and advertiser restrictions for these ads here. Releasing New Data for Good Tools Today we’re releasing new visualizations and datasets publicly to help researchers, NGOs and others combat the COVID-19 pandemic. You can learn more about these and our other Data for Good tools here. Tomorrow on #GivingTuesdayNow we’re expanding Community Help to make it easier for people to support local businesses and nonprofits. Starting tomorrow, people will be able to find gift cards and vouchers to support local businesses, donate to local nonprofit fundraisers, sign up to become a blood donor and find local job opportunities — all in Community Help.  Partnering with ITDRC and NetHope to Address the Digital Divide The coronavirus pandemic has underscored the importance of internet connectivity. While many people have shifted their lives online, there are still more than 3.5 billion people, including more than 18 million Americans, who lack reliable internet access. To help, we’re partnering with the Information Technology Disaster Resource Center (ITDRC) and NetHope to provide internet connectivity to communities most impacted by COVID-19. The goal of these partnerships is to better understand the unique barriers these communities face in getting online and create the programs and infrastructure needed to increase the availability and affordability of high-quality internet access. Update on Content Review Work Throughout the COVID-19 crisis, we’ve worked to keep both our workforce and the people who use our platforms safe. Last month we announced that we would temporarily send our content reviewers home. Since then we’ve shared updates on changes we’ve made to keep our platform safe during this time, including increasing the use of automation, carefully prioritizing user reports, and temporarily altering our appeals process. We’ve also asked some of our full-time employees to review content related to real-world harm like child safety and suicide and self-injury. It’s become clear in recent weeks that our offices are unlikely to return to business as usual in the near future. Some of our full-time employees will continue to review sensitive content, but as Mark referenced last week we will begin working with our partners to bring a small number of content reviewers back to offices to support these efforts in the coming weeks. Returning to the office will be voluntary. We’ll also work with our partners to put protections in place to keep content reviewers safe. These will include: greatly reducing building capacity in these offices to ensure government guidelines on physical distancing can be observed, implementing strict cleaning protocols and providing personal protective equipment like masks and gloves as well as temperature checks at the beginning of every shift. As the situation evolves, we’ll continue to share changes we make to keep both our community and the people who review content on our platforms safe. Facebook Joins Open COVID Patent Pledge Today Facebook joined Amazon, Hewlett Packard, IBM, and Microsoft in signing the Open COVID Patent Pledge to help make patents freely available in the fight against COVID-19. The pledge allows people to use our patents to advance innovation that may help in ending the COVID-19 pandemic and minimizing the impact of the disease —\\xa0without any uncertainty around intellectual property rights or fear of litigation. Sharing COVID-19 Symptom Maps and Expanding Survey Globally to Help Predict Disease Spread Today Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) Delphi Research Center made public the initial results of their US symptom survey we promoted on Facebook. Using aggregate data from Carnegie Mellon, Facebook produced its first report and new interactive maps, which we plan to update daily through this outbreak. Mark Zuckerberg wrote in the Washington Post\\xa0about how surveys like this can be an important tool in fighting COVID-19 and announced that we’re working with faculty from the University of Maryland to expand the program globally.  Limiting the Spread of COVID-19 Misinformation Today we shared some additional steps we’re taking to combat COVID-19 related misinformation and make sure people have the accurate information they need to stay safe. Making It Easier to Support Businesses on Instagram We’re making it easier for people to support the businesses they love through gift cards, online food orders and fundraisers all on Instagram.

Getting Expert Insights on How We Can Safely Re-Open Society Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan are live with Dr. Tom Frieden, the former director of the CDC and founder of Resolve to Save Lives. They’ll discuss how we can contain the spread of COVID-19 and how we should approach reopening society. Helping the WHO Share Timely Information on Messenger Today the World Health Organization (WHO) launched an interactive experience on Messenger to provide accurate and timely information about the coronavirus outbreak. People will now be able to message the WHO with questions about COVID-19 and get quick answers for free. The WHO created this Messenger experience with support from Sprinklr as part of the program we recently announced to pair developer partners with health organizations to help them connect with people and deliver critical information during the COVID-19 outbreak. Learn more. Connecting People to Well-Being Tips and Resources The COVID-19 pandemic has forced people around the world to adjust to new routines, cope with loneliness, job loss, grief and more. And it’s tough for all of us in different ways, not just physically but mentally. To help, we’re sharing tips from experts to stay well, supporting the work of mental health organizations, and giving you tools to manage your time on Facebook.  Helping People Get Reliable Information In Groups and Local Alerts As people are turning to Groups to connect with communities they care about and get support during this time, we want to make it easy to find and share reliable information in groups. Here are a few things we’re doing:  In addition, we more than doubled the number of state and local governments and health agencies onboarded to Facebook local alerts, so we now have more than 2,000 partners using the tool to communicate timely information to their communities. New Tools to Help Health Researchers Track and Combat COVID-19 Today we’re announcing new Data for Good tools to support health researchers and nonprofits:  Helping Small Businesses Today we’re sharing an update on our efforts to help small businesses get through this challenging time. These include:  Making It Easier for People to Request or Offer Help in Their Communities Today we’re announcing Community Help, a place for people to request or offer help to neighbors, such as volunteering to deliver groceries or donating to a local food pantry or fundraiser. You can access Community Help in the COVID-19 Information Center on Facebook or by visiting facebook.com/covidsupport. We’re starting to roll it out in the US, the UK, France, Australia and Canada in the next few days, and we’re working to bring it to more countries in the coming weeks.   Donating $25 Million to Support Healthcare Workers Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan are live with Governor Gavin Newsom to talk about California’s response to the COVID-19 outbreak. They’ll discuss the urgent need for more healthcare workers and Facebook’s $25 million donation to help support healthcare workers on the front line. Investing $100 Million in the News Industry The news industry is working under extraordinary conditions to keep people informed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Today we’re announcing an additional $100-million investment to support journalists — including $25 million in emergency grant funding for local news through the Facebook Journalism Project, and an extra $75 million in marketing to get money to publishers around the world at a time when their advertising revenue is declining. This investment is in addition to the support we’ve already pledged to the news industry in response to COVID-19: $1 million in grants for local news, $1 million in grants for fact-checking organizations, and a $1-million donation to the International Fact-Checking Network. Launching the Messenger Coronavirus Community Hub Today, we’re launching the Messenger Coronavirus Community Hub with tips and resources to keep people connected to their friends, family, colleagues and community, and prevent the spread of misinformation. It also includes advice on how to recognize and avoid scams and misinformation online. Read more about how you can use Messenger to stay connected and informed during this time. Helping Young People Safely Navigate the Internet Today we’re launching our digital literacy program, Get Digital, to provide lessons and resources to help young people develop the competencies and skills they need to more safely navigate the internet. These resources are designed to be used by educators and families both in the classroom and at home, but they’ve become even more important as young people spend more time on their devices while at home during the COVID-19 outbreak. Get Digital will help young people learn how to: It will also help them discover how technology can be used for civic and political engagement. And it can help them develop digital skills, such as understanding algorithms, and explore programming and more to help prepare them for future careers in technology. We’re partnering with UNESCO, the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE), National PTA, and EVERFI to distribute our new digital literacy tools to parents and educators around the world. Lessons are drawn from the Youth and Media team at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University, which has made them freely available worldwide under a Creative Commons license, and the Greater Good Science Center. Sharing Tips for People Working Remotely Remote work can be challenging whether you’re balancing caregiving and work, trying to lead a dispersed team, or adjusting to a new routine and responsibilities. That’s why we created an online resource with tips to help our global team stay connected, be productive and do their best work, wherever they’re working. We’re sharing it publicly today in case it’s helpful to others as many adjust to working remotely during this challenging time. Check out our remote work resources. Combating COVID-19 Misinformation Across Our Apps Today we shared an overview of how we’re connecting people to reliable information and taking aggressive steps to combat COVID-19 misinformation across our apps. Keeping Our Apps Stable and Reliable As more people around the world are physically distancing themselves from others, we’ve seen people using our apps more than ever. Today, we shared some data to give context on the load we’re managing. Our apps were built to withstand spikes, but the usage growth from COVID-19 is unprecedented across the industry. We’re monitoring usage patterns carefully, making our systems more efficient and adding capacity when needed, and we’re doing everything we can to keep our apps stable and reliable during this time. Helping People Stay Informed and Connected on Instagram Today we announced updates to help people stay informed, safe and connected on Instagram during this challenging time. These include: Helping Government Health Organizations Use Messenger Today we’re announcing two initiatives to help government health organizations in their response to the coronavirus outbreak using Messenger. Read more about how we’re leveraging Messenger’s reach, tools and technology to help people stay connected and informed during this time. Launching the WHO Health Alert on WhatsApp Today we launched the World Health Organization’s Health Alert on WhatsApp. The WHO Health Alert is free to use and will answer common questions about COVID-19. It provides timely, reliable information about how to prevent the spread of the coronavirus as well as travel advice, coronavirus myth debunking and more. To contact the WHO Health Alert, save the number +41 79 893 1892 in your phone contacts and then text the word ‘Hi’ in a WhatsApp message to get started. The service is initially launching in English but will be available in all six United Nations languages (English, Arabic, Chinese, French, Russian and Spanish) within the coming weeks. It’s an honor to work with @WHO to provide this simple service to get the latest information directly from the experts right on WhatsApp. Tap the link below to get started. Share these tips and de-bunked rumors with your friends and family 🙏 https://t.co/WWhbKccdAB pic.twitter.com/EYCuAliCk2 — WhatsApp Inc. (@WhatsApp) March 20, 2020  Keeping Our Platform Safe With Remote and Reduced Content Review We recently announced that we’re temporarily sending content reviewers home. We want to make sure our platform remains a safe place for people to connect during this time, but with a reduced and remote workforce, below are some ways our content review processes will be impacted. Policy Enforcement: We will continue to enforce our policies and prioritize preventing and disrupting harm across our platform. We are conducting human rights due diligence, looking at potential risks, and putting in place contingency plans that both prioritize the safety of our content reviewers and support the integrity of our platform. As Mark Zuckerberg discussed on a press call, for example, we have shifted certain content review work to full time employees and are focusing on areas including child safety, terrorism, suicide and self-injury, and harmful content related to COVID-19. Some contract reviewers will work from home, but with a reduced and remote workforce, we will now rely more on our automated systems to detect and remove violating content and disable accounts.\\xa0As a result, we expect to make more mistakes, and reviews will take longer than normal, but we will continue to monitor how our systems are performing and make adjustments. In addition, reviewing content can be challenging, and working from home presents new obstacles in providing support to our teams, but we’re working to ensure our content reviewers have the resources and help they need during this time. User Reports: When people report content to us that they believe violates our policies, they will see a new message letting them know that we have fewer content reviewers available and will prioritize reported content that has the greatest potential \\u200bto harm our community. This means some reports will not be reviewed as quickly as they used to be and we will not get to some reports at all. Appeals: Normally when we remove content, we offer the person who posted it the option to request that we review the content again if they think we made a mistake. Now, given our reduced workforce, we’ll give people the option to tell us that they disagree with our decision and we’ll monitor that feedback to improve our accuracy, but we likely won’t review content a second time. We’re working hard to minimize any impact on people as they use Facebook, Instagram and Messenger during this time, but we know some may feel this impact either when reporting content to us or appealing content we remove. We’re doing everything we can to keep our global teams and the community that uses our apps safe while continuing to provide the services people and businesses rely on. Getting Expert Health Tips and Information From Dr. Fauci Mark Zuckerberg is live with Dr. Anthony Fauci, America’s top infectious disease expert involved in leading our government’s response to COVID-19. They’ll discuss how we can all help fight the spread of the coronavirus and what governments are doing to respond to the pandemic. Banning Ads for Hand Sanitizer, Disinfecting Wipes and COVID-19 Testing Kits In addition to masks, we’re now also banning ads and commerce listings for hand sanitizer, surface disinfecting wipes and COVID-19 testing kits. And if we see people selling these products in organic posts on Facebook or Instagram, we’ll remove them. We’ll be ramping up our automated enforcement for ads and commerce next week.  If we see abuse around these products in organic posts, we\\'ll remove those, too (2/2) — Rob Leathern (@robleathern) March 19, 2020  Minimizing Disruptions for Businesses and Partners on Our\\xa0Platform As we announced on Monday,\\xa0we’re working with our partners to send home all contract workers who perform content review, until further notice. Since this includes people who review ads and monetized content, we wanted to share more about what this means for advertisers, publishers and creators that use our tools. For Advertisers We use a combination of people and technology to review ads on Facebook and Instagram, and our automated systems already play a big role in that process. Now with a reduced and remote workforce, we’re relying on automated technology even more. This may mean: For Content Creators and Publishers All monetized content goes through brand safety reviews. This includes Instant Articles and videos with in-stream ads. Since our ability to review new content is now limited, we won’t be able to approve all content for monetization. We’re working on how to support partners at this time. As this situation continues to evolve, we may need to make further changes to our systems. While we’re working to minimize disruptions for businesses and partners, we will inevitably make mistakes. We will do our best to address any issues as quickly as we can and continue to provide updates. Press Call Recap This morning on a press call, Mark Zuckerberg shared how we’re supporting people and businesses affected by the coronavirus outbreak and how we’re working with health authorities to make sure everyone can access accurate information. He also announced a new Coronavirus Information Center on Facebook to help people find information and tips, and he shared how we’re giving governments and emergency services around the world free access to Workplace. Read the full transcript from his press call. Offering Workplace to Government and Emergency Organizations for Free Starting today, we’re offering Workplace Advanced to government agencies and emergency services free of charge for 12 months. These organizations play a vital role during the coronavirus outbreak, whether it’s acting as first responders or coordinating public information. Workplace can help inform and connect their employees, allowing them to share critical information in real-time and enabling leadership to reach employees via live videos, posts and more. Read more about how we’re supporting emergency services and government organizations during this time.  Launching the Coronavirus Information Center on Facebook Today we’re announcing the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Information Center, featured at the top of News Feed, to provide a central place for people to get the latest news and information as well as resources and tips to stay healthy and support their family and community. It includes real-time updates from national health authorities and global organizations such as the World Health Organization, as well as helpful articles, videos and posts about social distancing and preventing the spread of COVID-19. People can also follow the Coronavirus Information Center to receive updates from health authorities directly in their News Feed. And starting in the US, people will see features to help them connect with local groups and ask for or offer help within their community. We’re rolling out the information center in Italy, France, Germany, Spain, the UK and the US within the next 24 hours, and we’ll expand it to more countries in the coming days.  Helping People Stay Connected Using WhatsApp In these uncertain times, reliable communication is critical. That’s why we’ve nearly doubled server capacity for WhatsApp and continue to see strong reliability as people place more voice and video calls around the world. In addition, today we launched an information hub with tips on how healthcare workers, educators and local businesses can stay connected using WhatsApp. We also donated $1 million to the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) to expand the presence of local fact-checkers on WhatsApp. We’re grateful to @who @undp @unicef for coordinating the response to this crisis including using @WhatsApp to do so. Already several ministries of health are providing updates to citizens on WhatsApp and we will expand these services together. — Will Cathcart (@wcathcart) March 18, 2020  Supporting Fact-Checkers and Local News Organizations To support fact-checkers in their work around COVID-19, we’re partnering with The International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) to launch a $1 million grant program to increase their capacity during this time. We’re also supporting local news organizations as they deal with unexpected costs of covering COVID-19 and provide increased coverage during this time. To help, the Facebook Journalism Project is partnering with the Lenfest Institute for Journalism and the Local Media Association to offer a total of $1 million in grants to local news organizations covering COVID-19 in the US and Canada. Investing $100 Million in Small Businesses We’re creating a $100 million grant program to help small businesses around the world impacted by the coronavirus.  Keeping Our People and Our Platforms Safe To keep our people safe, we recently requested that anyone who can work from home do so in all of our offices around the world. We are also continuing to take the necessary steps to keep our platform safe. Over the past couple of years we’ve substantially scaled up our investments in safety and security, including by rapidly growing content review teams and expanding our machine learning capabilities. For both our full-time employees and contract workforce there is some work that cannot be done from home due to safety, privacy and legal reasons. We have taken precautions to protect our workers by cutting down the number of people in any given office, implementing recommended work from home globally, physically spreading people out at any given office and doing additional cleaning. Given the rapidly evolving public health concerns, we are taking additional steps to protect our teams and will be working with our partners over the course of this week to send all contract workers who perform content review home, until further notice. We’ll ensure that all workers are paid during this time. We believe the investments we’ve made over the past three years have prepared us for this situation. With fewer people available for human review we’ll continue to prioritize imminent harm and increase our reliance on proactive detection in other areas to remove violating content. We don’t expect this to impact people using our platform in any noticeable way. That said, there may be some limitations to this approach and we may see some longer response times and make more mistakes as a result. These are unprecedented times, but the safety and security of our platform will continue.\\xa0 We are grateful to all of our teams working hard to continue doing the essential work to keep our community safe. Working With Industry Partners Joint industry statement from Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Reddit, Twitter and YouTube “We are working closely together on COVID-19 response efforts. We’re helping millions of people stay connected while also jointly combating fraud and misinformation about the virus, elevating authoritative content on our platforms, and sharing critical updates in coordination with government healthcare agencies around the world. We invite other companies to join us as we work to keep our communities healthy and safe.”  Matching $20 Million in Donations to Support COVID-19 Relief Efforts We’re matching $20 million in donations to support COVID-19 relief efforts.  Connecting People With Credible Health Information on Instagram We shared updates on our efforts to support the Instagram community during this time. To help people get relevant and up-to-date resources, we will start showing more information from @WHO and local health ministries at the top of Instagram’s Feed in some countries. pic.twitter.com/czAHYItlEx — Instagram Comms (@InstagramComms) March 13, 2020  To thank the health workers who have been working tirelessly to keep their communities safe, we developed a sticker for people to show their gratitude on Instagram. This will be available in the stickers gallery. pic.twitter.com/BS5IKAWBuL — Instagram Comms (@InstagramComms) March 13, 2020  Supporting Businesses and Community Leaders To help people stay safe and informed during the COVID-19 outbreak, we’re providing additional resources to our community. We shared a blog post on our Community Hub to provide accurate information on disease prevention and connect community leaders with tools to help them manage their community. We also created a Business Resource Hub that includes tips and trainings to help businesses navigate challenges during the COVID-19 outbreak and support their customers during this time. Expanding Access to Facebook Local Alerts In addition, we’re helping local governments and emergency response organizations more easily communicate with their communities. As COVID-19 has spread in the US, local governments have used Facebook to share critical information with their communities about this fast evolving situation. Because of the increasing need to get timely and accurate information to local communities, we’re expanding access to Facebook local alerts to even more municipal governments, state and local emergency response organizations and law enforcement agencies. State and local public health agencies will now also have the ability to push out timely, accurate information to their local communities. And we’ll provide additional training to partners as they start using local alerts to share best practices for using the tool most effectively. Eligible organizations and government agencies can request access to the local alerts tool here. Banning Ads and Commerce Listings for Medical Face Masks We are temporarily banning advertisements and commerce listings, like those on Marketplace, that sell medical face masks. We’ll begin to enforce this change over the next few days. We already prohibit people from making health or medical claims related to the coronavirus in product listings on commerce surfaces, including those listings that guarantee a product will prevent someone from contracting it. We also have a dedicated channel for local governments to share listings they believe violate local laws. Our teams are monitoring the COVID-19 situation closely and will make necessary updates to our policies if we see people trying to exploit this public health emergency. Update: We’re banning ads and commerce listings selling medical face masks. We’re monitoring COVID19 closely and will make necessary updates to our policies if we see people trying to exploit this public health emergency. We’ll start rolling out this change in the days ahead. — Rob Leathern (@robleathern) March 7, 2020  Removing COVID-19 Misinformation on Instagram Today we shared updates about the changes we’ve made to keep the Instagram community safe and informed on COVID-19. We’re removing known harmful misinformation related to COVID-19, and when someone taps on a hashtag related to COVID-19, we show resources from @WHO, @CDC and local health authorities. pic.twitter.com/Dw2Y8ZwfaI — Instagram Comms (@InstagramComms) March 6, 2020  Finally, we’re thinking through a longer term solution to help connect people searching COVID-19 related terms with credible information. In the meantime, we’re showing the accounts of leading health organizations in these searches to better connect people to credible resources. pic.twitter.com/RUNwJh94Cf — Instagram Comms (@InstagramComms) March 6, 2020  Supporting Global Health Organizations With Free Ads and More CEO Mark Zuckerberg posted about the latest steps Facebook is taking.  As world health officials issue new guidance and warnings about coronavirus (COVID-19), we’re continuing our work to connect people to information from regional and local health organizations and limit the spread of misinformation and harmful content about the virus. Connecting People to Accurate Information and Helpful Resources Anyone who searches for information related to the virus on Facebook is shown educational pop-ups on top of search results connecting them to expert health organizations including the World Health Organization (WHO). We’ve launched these globally over the last few weeks in all languages on Facebook, directing people to the WHO. In several countries we are directing people to their local ministry of health. For example, in the US we are directing people to information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and in Singapore, we’re directing people to the Singapore Ministry of Health. Moreover, in countries where the WHO has reported person-to-person transmission and deaths, we’ve shown additional messages to people toward the top of News Feed with more information.  Exploitative Tactics in Ads Yesterday we put a new policy into effect to protect people from those trying to exploit this emergency for financial gain. This means we are now prohibiting ads for products that refer to the coronavirus in ways intended to create a panic or imply that their products guarantee a cure or prevent people from contracting it. For example, ads for face masks that imply they are the only ones still available or claim that they are guaranteed to prevent the virus from spreading will not be allowed to run on our platforms. Today, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus a public health emergency of international concern. As the global public health community works to keep people safe, Facebook is supporting their work in several ways, most especially by working to limit the spread of misinformation and harmful content about the virus and connecting people to helpful information. Here are some specific steps we are taking. Our global network of third-party fact-checkers are continuing their work reviewing content and debunking false claims that are spreading related to the coronavirus. When they rate information as false, we limit its spread on Facebook and Instagram and show people accurate information from these partners. We also send notifications to people who already shared or are trying to share this content to alert them that it’s been fact-checked. We will also start to remove content with false claims or conspiracy theories that have been flagged by leading global health organizations and local health authorities that could cause harm to people who believe them. We are doing this as an extension of our existing policies to remove content that could cause physical harm. We’re focusing on claims that are designed to discourage treatment or taking appropriate precautions. This includes claims related to false cures or prevention methods — like drinking bleach cures the coronavirus — or claims that create confusion about health resources that are available. We will also block or restrict hashtags used to spread misinformation on Instagram, and are conducting proactive sweeps to find and remove as much of this content as we can. Our platforms are already being used to help people connect with accurate information about the situation, including from global and regional health organizations. We’ve been closely coordinating with leading health organizations to make this easier and more accessible for people using Facebook and Instagram. For example, we will help people get relevant and up-to-date information from partners through messages on top of News Feed on Facebook; these will be deployed based on guidance from the WHO. When people search for information related to the virus on Facebook or tap a related hashtag on Instagram, we will surface an educational pop-up with credible information. We have also provided free advertising credits to enable organizations to run coronavirus education campaigns on Facebook and Instagram in affected regions and are discussing ways to provide additional assistance and support to health authorities. We are empowering leading researchers at Harvard University’s School of Public Health and National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan by sharing aggregated and anonymized mobility data and high resolution population density maps to help inform their forecasting models for the spread of the virus as part of our broader Data for Good program. We may expand these efforts to a broader set of partners in the coming weeks. We are also helping partners understand how people are talking about the issue online through tools like CrowdTangle to better inform their efforts. Not all of these steps are fully in place. It will take some time to roll them out across our platforms and step up our enforcement methods. We will provide updates on additional steps we are taking in coordination with global and regional partners as the situation continues to evolve.
